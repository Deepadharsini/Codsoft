                    Hello! I’m <b><i>Deepadharsini K</i></b>, a Web Developer with hands-on experience in web development.
                    I specialize in creating user-friendly websites, and I’m passionate about it. As a fresher in web development, I have hands-on experience in building responsive, dynamic websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm skilled in front-end frameworks like React to create interactive user interfaces, and familiar with back-end technologies like Node.js and Express for developing robust server-side applications. I have worked on several projects, including personal portfolios and e-commerce platforms, which have enhanced my skills in both front-end and back-end development. Eager to learn and adapt to new technologies, I am excited to apply my knowledge to real-world web projects and contribute to innovative, high-quality web solutions.

                <h3>Smart Plant Monitoring System using IoT</h3>
                <p>A Smart Plant Monitoring System using IoT is an innovative solution that leverages sensors and internet connectivity to monitor and maintain optimal conditions for plant growth. The system uses sensors to track key environmental factors such as soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and light intensity. These sensors collect real-time data, which is transmitted to an IoT platform for analysis.
                    <br><br>
                    Based on the collected data, the system can provide notifications or take automated actions, such as watering the plants or adjusting lighting. The system can be accessed remotely via a smartphone or web application, allowing users to monitor and control plant care from anywhere. This technology is highly beneficial for precision agriculture, indoor gardening, and smart home applications, promoting healthier plant growth with minimal manual intervention.

                <h3>Freshfleet - Online Grocery Shopping Site</h3>
                <p>This project aims to develop a centralized online grocery platform utilizing the MERN 
                (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. The platform will provide a user-friendly 
                interface for customers to browse and purchase groceries, while offering vendors a platform to 
                manage their products and deliveries. Key features include vendor and customer account 
                management, real-time delivery tracking, secure payment processing, product reviews, chatbot 
                support, personalized recommendations, direct farm purchases, and detailed nutrition 
                information. By integrating these functionalities, the platform seeks to streamline the grocery 
                shopping experience, enhance customer satisfaction, and support local farmers.
